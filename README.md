# Senior-Marketplace-Application
As an academic project, designed a senior caregiver services marketplace application where users can easily find the right services to meet their needs at any stage of health.

Used Python as the backend language, Flask handles the server-side logic, dynamic content generation, and routing, 
while Bootstrap enhances the user interface by providing a consistent and visually appealing design.

The mission is to provide an easy digestible, multi-sided marketplace with vetted, curated
caregiver services which serve as both a resource and guide to make the overwhelming
situation of caregiving, feel manageable
The 'bit' is to provide a 'one stop shop' marketplace for better care of the ageing
population and the wellbeing of the caregivers who provide for them.


Our market researched validated the underlying problem and the need for our solution.
By 2060 the number of Americans aged 65 and older will more than double from 46 to 98
million. The share of people older than 65 in the total population will rise from 15% to 24%.
In the U.S., 27% of adults ages 60 and older live alone, compared with 16% of adults
internationally
U.S. adults ages 60 and older also are more likely than their counterparts around the
world to live as a couple without young children at home. 46% of Americans in this age
group share a home with only one spouse or partner, compared with 30% globally
Of the more than 43 million caregivers who provide care for someone aged 50+, 45% are
also 50+
Four-in-ten seniors now own smartphones, more than double the share that did so in
2013, and roughly one-third (32%) of seniors say they own tablet computers. so
technology adoption is there.
Even in assisted living communities, seniors order their own personal services and care
services depending on their insurance.
